## Social attributes of "lazy accent" (懶音）in Cantonese.
This repository contains the materials for a web-based experiment exploring potential social meaning(s) of the "lazy accent" (懶音）in Cantonese. The colloquial term "lazy accent" (懶音) refers to eight in-progress (some near-complete) diachronic sound changes. Here, I investigate three sound changes in particular: /n-/ -> /l-/; /ŋ-/ -> /ʔ-/; /-ŋ/ -> /-n/. 

The experiment was completed as part of LING245B: Methods in Psycholinguistics. Participants were recruited through Prolific.
